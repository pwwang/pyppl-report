# References/Links

- Something needs ref [[1]]
  ```markdown
      - Something needs ref [[ 1 ]] <!--- No space in real case  -->

      - Another statement needs ref [[ 2 ]]

      ... ...

      [[1]]: ref1
      [[2]]: ref2
  ```
- Another statement needs ref [[2]]

- [A link with attributes](somelink "title"){a=1 b=2 c="xy" d=False f="m, n"}
  ```markdown
  [A link with attributes](somelink "title"){a=1 b=2 c="xy" d=False f="m, n"}

  ```

- [A downloadable link](./downloadfile.txt){download=true}
  ```markdown
  [A downloadable link](./downloadfile.txt){download=true}
  ```

  :::{.admon .note}
  If links are relative path to local files, they should be relative to the markdown file.

# Images

:::{.admon .note}
Images are lazy-loaded.
:::

## Add a single image

```markdown
<!-- empty line -->
![Snapshot](./snapshot.png){attributes ...}
<!-- empty line -->
```

![Snapshot](./snapshot.png)

## Add images as a combined figure

```markdown
<!-- no empty lines among the images -->
![Snapshot](./snapshot.png)
![Snapshot](./snapshot.png)
![Snapshot](./snapshot.png)
```

![Snapshot](./snapshot.png)
![Snapshot](./snapshot.png)
![Snapshot](./snapshot.png)

:::{.admon .note}
Relative image path should be relative to the markdown file.

When `pyppl_report` work as a `PyPPL` plugin, we usually pass the absolute path.
However, when it works as a CLI tool, relative path may be used.

# Panels

A set of panels are blocks that only occupy one panel space in the page by using tabs or accordions,
based on the number of this set of panels.

## Auto-decision to use tabs or accordions

When number of panels <= `4` we will use tabs, otherwise accordions are used.

```markdown
::: {.panel head=Panel1}
Panel1 contents ...
:::

::: {.panel head=Panel2}
![Snapshot](./snapshot.png)
:::

```

:::{.admon .tip}

We can also use headings (`H1` up to `H5`) as the head/title of the panel, which will
be useful if you want to put the headings in TOC.
```markdown
::: {.panel}
### Panel1

Panel1 contents ...
:::

::: {.panel}
### Panel2

![Snapshot](./snapshot.png)
:::
```

:::

::: {.panel}
### Panel1

Panel1 contents ...
:::

::: {.panel}
### Panel2

![Snapshot](./snapshot.png)
:::

::: {.admon .note}
A collection of `panel`s will be automatically formed a tab or accordion sets. However, they
have to be adjacent. Otherwise, they will be built as separate sets of tabs or accordions.
:::

## Accordions

::: {.panel}
### Panel1
Panel1 contents
:::

::: {.panel head=Panel2}
Panel2 contents

This panel will be hidden in TOC, as I used:
`::: {.panel head=Panel2}`
:::

::: {.panel}
### Panel3
Panel3 contents
:::

::: {.panel}
### Panel4
