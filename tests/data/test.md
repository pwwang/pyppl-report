:::{.admon .note}
Images are lazy-loaded.
:::

## Add a single image

```markdown
<!-- empty line -->
![Snapshot](./snapshot.png){attributes ...}
<!-- empty line -->
```

![Snapshot](./snapshot.png)

## Add images as a combined figure

```markdown
<!-- no empty lines among the images -->
![Snapshot](./snapshot.png)
![Snapshot](./snapshot.png)
![Snapshot](./snapshot.png)
```

![Snapshot](./snapshot.png)
![Snapshot](./snapshot.png)
![Snapshot](./snapshot.png)

:::{.admon .note}
Relative image path should be relative to the markdown file.

When `pyppl_report` work as a `PyPPL` plugin, we usually pass the absolute path.
However, when it works as a CLI tool, relative path may be used.

# Panels

A set of panels are blocks that only occupy one panel space in the page by using tabs or accordions,
based on the number of this set of panels.

## Auto-decide to use tabs or accordions

When number of panels <= 4 we will use tabs, otherwise accordions are used.

```markdown
::: {.panel head=Panel1}
panel1
:::

::: {.panel head=Panel2}
panel2
:::

```

::: {.panel head=Panel1}
panel1
:::

::: {.panel head=Panel2}
panel2
:::

## Accordions

::: {.panel head=Panel1}
panel1
:::

::: {.panel head=Panel2}
panel2
:::

::: {.panel head=Panel1}
panel1
:::

::: {.panel head=Panel2}
panel2
